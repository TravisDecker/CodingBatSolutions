## CodingBat

CodingBat Challenges provide a description of the challenge and sample input and output.
Once you run a solution you can see the test cases coding bat runs. 
Our format is a class name that matches the challenge name, and a getter method. Using Junit we create parameterised 
tests with tests cases from CodingBat.
